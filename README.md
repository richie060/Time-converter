# Time-converter

This Java program prompts the user to enter the current time in military time and the number of hours that have passed, 
then calculates the new hour based on these inputs. It uses an if statement to check if the new hour is less than 10 before
using a switch statement to convert it to a string with a leading zero. Otherwise, it uses the toString() method to 
convert the new hour to a string. Finally, it displays the new time of day in military time.
